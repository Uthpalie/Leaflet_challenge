# USGS Earthquake Data Visualization Tool
This project aims to develop a visualization tool for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to effectively present their extensive earthquake data collected worldwide. The USGS plays a crucial role in providing scientific insights into natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental conditions, and the impacts of climate and land-use changes. However, they currently lack a comprehensive method to visually represent their earthquake data, which hinders their ability to educate the public and inform government organizations effectively.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and informative visualization platform that will:

Educate the Public: Provide accessible and engaging visualizations to enhance public understanding of earthquake activities globally.
Inform Government Agencies: Enable government organizations to make informed decisions based on real-time and historical earthquake data trends.
Support Funding Initiatives: Demonstrate the importance of USGS data by showcasing its relevance and impact on global and regional scales.

## Features

### Interactive Maps: Display earthquake data points on an interactive map interface.
### Data Filters: Allow users to filter earthquakes based on magnitude, location, depth, and time.
### Visualization Tools: Provide tools for visualizing earthquake frequency, intensity, and distribution over time.
### Educational Resources: Include informative overlays, legends, and tooltips to educate users about earthquake parameters and their significance.

## Technologies Used

### Mapping Library: Utilize Leaflet or similar libraries for interactive map functionalities.
### Data Handling: Process and analyze USGS earthquake data using Python, JavaScript, or other suitable programming languages.
### Visualization: Implement data visualization techniques using libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for dynamic and informative graphical representations.
